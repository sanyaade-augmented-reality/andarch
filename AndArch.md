1. 	INTRODUCTION

1.1	 Overview
> The Project AndArch aims to simplify the work of architects of demonstrating architectural models. The goal of the project is to create an easy to use application for the Android platform that can be used by technically naÃ¯ve users. AndArch can also be used by civil engineers and mechanical engineers to view building models and machine models respectively. Marker based augmented reality is used to improve the usability of the application and improve the manipulation.

1.2	 Brief Description
> In day-to-day life architects always face the problem of displaying their models to their clients. They use three methods to display these architectural models like printouts, using CAD softwares, making 3D models of cardboard. All these methods have their own disadvantages like printouts are not realistic since they are a 2D representation, CAD softwares requires technical knowledge and cardboard models are fragile and takes lots of time to be made. So we thought of augmented reality as an alternative to view these 3D models. So by using augmented reality we thought of rendering 3D architectural models on Android based mobile which can resolve almost all the above mentioned problems.

1.3	 Problem Definition
> Input a live video stream and augment it by replacing the tracked marker with a photorealistic representation of an arbitrarily chosen 3D architectural model on an Android mobile device.

Project AndArch will be a major breakthrough in the architectural and engineering world as it will enable architects to view models on the go on his mobile. This project could possibly revolutionize the way architectural models are presented. The application is innovative for the fact that no such application has been implemented for viewing architectural models on mobiles. Also, the project AndArch aims to make the current algorithms more efficient for the slower processors of the current Android mobiles.
The project will limit itself to the use of marker-based algorithms and will not extend to marker-less algorithms. The photorealism of the generated models will be limited to as such as can be supported comfortably on the target device (a 500 MHz processor mobile running android 2.2 (Froyo) ). The application will support .OBJ files. The application will track the current relative spatial position of the camera and adjust the model accordingly, thus giving the illusion of reality and a non-intrusive natural interface.The 3D photorealistic AR models would be interactive and can be easily manipulated for a comprehensive review.
